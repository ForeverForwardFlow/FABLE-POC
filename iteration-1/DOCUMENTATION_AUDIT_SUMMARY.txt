# FABLE Documentation Audit - Executive Summary

Review Date: January 29, 2026
Status: STRONG POC with clear gaps for human developers

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT: B+ / 8.5/10
================================================================================

The FABLE POC has EXCELLENT documentation for AI agent autonomy but SIGNIFICANT
gaps for human developer onboarding.

WHAT WORKS WELL
===============

1. Types are self-documenting (9/10)
   - Every interface field has JSDoc
   - Shared types eliminate duplication
   - Claude can understand system from types alone

2. Rules are comprehensive (9/10)
   - Five well-organized rules files
   - Each rule has rationale
   - Security and anti-patterns documented

3. Worker task CLAUDE.md generated correctly (8/10)
   - Task-specific instructions dynamic
   - Includes verification commands
   - Links to monorepo structure

4. Code is self-explanatory (8/10)
   - Phase functions documented
   - Utility functions have JSDoc
   - Comments explain why

WHAT'S MISSING (Critical for Humans)
====================================

1. NO README.md - New developers have no entry point
2. NO quick start guide - Can't figure out "npm run ..." commands
3. Orchestrator CLAUDE.md lacks detail - Phase logic unexplained
4. NO API reference - MCP server interface not documented
5. NO troubleshooting guide - Developers stuck with errors
6. NO example walkthrough - Must discover greeting/ manually

================================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS
================================================================================

CLAUDE.md Files (Score: 8/10)
=============================
Root CLAUDE.md: Excellent - Concise, clear architecture, key interfaces
Orchestrator CLAUDE.md: Good - But phases unexplained, integration missing
Template CLAUDE.md: Good - Clear requirements, but no reference to greeting/

README Files (Score: 2/10)
==========================
FINDING: None exist. Critical gap.

Type Documentation (Score: 9/10)
================================
Excellent. Every interface fully documented with JSDoc.
Only gap: interfaceContracts format not defined

Code Comments (Score: 8/10)
===========================
Strengths: JSDoc on all public functions, section headers, phase docs
Gaps: Why patterns exist (spatial decomposition, worker isolation)

Rules Files (Score: 9/10)
=========================
design-principles.md: 9/10 - Excellent philosophy and anti-patterns
architecture.md: 9/10 - Clear rationale for all decisions
mcp-patterns.md: 8/10 - Good patterns, missing error handling
workers.md: 9/10 - Explicit constraints and completion criteria
security.md: 8/10 - Clear rules, missing recovery procedures

API Documentation (Score: 5/10)
===============================
Types exist (excellent). Tool patterns in greeting/ (implicit).
Missing: API.md reference, registration process, error formats

New Developer Onboarding (Score: 4/10)
======================================
Clone repo: Yes, works
Install: Yes, works
Understand purpose: No README
Build first MCP server: Possible but must reverse-engineer from greeting/

AI Agent Autonomy (Score: 9/10)
===============================
Workers CAN complete tasks autonomously with current docs.
Slight gaps: Why patterns required, error recovery strategies.

================================================================================
CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking Issues)
================================================================================

Gap 1: No Project Entry Point
Problem: New developers see no README, don't know what FABLE does
Impact: HIGH - First experience is confusion
Solution: Create README.md (30 min)

Gap 2: Orchestrator Phases Unexplained
Problem: orchestrator/CLAUDE.md doesn't explain how phases work
Impact: MEDIUM - Only developers need this, not workers
Solution: Enhance orchestrator/CLAUDE.md (30 min)

Gap 3: Worker Tasks Lack Context
Problem: Generated CLAUDE.md tells what to build, not why patterns matter
Impact: MEDIUM - Workers less efficient
Solution: Enhance generateTaskClaudeMd() (30 min)

Gap 4: Template Doesn't Link to Working Example
Problem: Builders follow template/ but don't find greeting/ patterns
Impact: MEDIUM - Must search for examples
Solution: Add reference section to template/CLAUDE.md (20 min)

Gap 5: Environment Configuration Scattered
Problem: Variables documented in multiple places
Impact: LOW - Workaround exists
Solution: Create .env.example (15 min)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY
================================================================================

P0: NEW DEVELOPER BLOCKER (Do First)
====================================

Action 1: Create README.md (30 min)
  - Quick start
  - Architecture overview
  - Next steps
  Impact: New developers productive in 30 minutes

Action 2: Create GETTING_STARTED.md (45 min)
  - Step-by-step setup
  - Build first MCP server walkthrough
  - Troubleshooting
  Impact: Walkthrough eliminates confusion

P1: WORKER AUTONOMY & DX (Do Next)
===================================

Action 3: Enhance orchestrator/CLAUDE.md (30 min)
  - Document each phase
  - Explain Ralph Wiggum
  - Concrete examples

Action 4: Improve template/CLAUDE.md (20 min)
  - Link to greeting/
  - Explain interface contracts
  - Error handling patterns

Action 5: Update dispatch.ts (30 min)
  - Enhance generateTaskClaudeMd()
  - Link to patterns
  - Troubleshooting hints

P2: MAINTAINABILITY (Do Later)
===============================

Action 6: Create .env.example (15 min)
Action 7: Create API.md (60 min)
Action 8: Add examples to rules (45 min)

TOTAL TIME: 4-5 hours (MVP with P0: 75 minutes)

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR HUMAN DEVELOPERS
================================================================================

After implementing recommendations:

1. Clone and setup (5 min)
   - Should work: git clone && npm install && npm run build

2. Understand purpose (10 min)
   - Read README
   - See example use case

3. Build first MCP server (30 min)
   - Follow GETTING_STARTED
   - Copy, modify, test

4. Extend system (time varies)
   - Reference working patterns
   - Debug failures

================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES CHECK
================================================================================

PRINCIPLE: "Lightweight > Overwrought"
STATUS: ✓ ACHIEVED
- CLAUDE.md files under 100 lines
- Rules organized by domain
- No bloat

PRINCIPLE: "Context-efficient"
STATUS: ✓ ACHIEVED
- Types are self-documenting
- Patterns reused from greeting/
- DRY respected

PRINCIPLE: "Verify programmatically"
STATUS: ✓ ACHIEVED
- Every phase has test commands
- Exit codes are source of truth

PRINCIPLE: "Autonomous-friendly"
STATUS: ✓ ACHIEVED
- Workers have clear criteria
- Tasks are testable
- Completion signal explicit

PRINCIPLE: "Few moving parts"
STATUS: ✗ ISSUE FOUND
- Documentation scattered across multiple locations
- Environment variables dispersed
- Single source of truth would help

================================================================================
STRENGTHS TO PRESERVE
================================================================================

1. Type-driven design - Keep JSDoc on all interfaces
2. Rules-based guidance - Anti-patterns approach works well
3. Pattern reuse - greeting/ is excellent reference
4. Programmatic verification - Don't add subjective checks
5. Task-specific CLAUDE.md - Excellent for worker autonomy

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

FABLE's documentation successfully achieves its PRIMARY GOAL: enabling AI
agents to work autonomously. This is EXCELLENT.

However, it UNDERSERVES HUMAN DEVELOPERS through lack of entry points and
missing context.

THE GAP IS NOT COMPLEXITY — IT'S VISIBILITY.

Adding README + GETTING_STARTED + enhanced phase docs will solve 80% of
issues in ~2 hours.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement P0 and P1 actions before POC validation. This gives
stakeholders confidence that the system is maintainable by humans, not just
autonomous agents.

================================================================================
